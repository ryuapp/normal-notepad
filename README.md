# Normal Notepad

A lightweight, overly simple notepad for nostalgic moods.

## Why not use Windows Notepad?

Windows Notepad has become too feature-rich and is no longer suitable for simple text editing. Additionally, the increased functionality has led to higher memory usage. I am creating this app to preserve a tool that allows for traditional, simple text editing.

Note: Many unnecessary features on Windows Notepad can be disabled in the settings.
